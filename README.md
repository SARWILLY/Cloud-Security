  # ☁️ 100 Days of AWS Cloud Security

Welcome to my first hands-on project exploring real-world scenarios in cloud computing security! This beginner-level journey spans 100 days of learning and experimentation with AWS services, focusing on foundational security practices.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Understand and apply core cloud security principles
- Gain practical experience with key AWS services such as:
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Build a solid foundation for advanced cloud security concepts

---

## 📌 Why AWS?
I've chosen **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** because:
- It’s the most widely used cloud platform globally
- It offers strong security tools and resources
- It has high demand in the job market  
> *(Azure and GCP are excellent too, but AWS is my launchpad for learning.)*

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- AWS Console & CLI
- EC2, S3, IAM, VPC
- Basic Networking & Security Groups
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker
| Week | Task Description | Status |
|-----|------------------|--------|

## 🔰 Important Note
This is a beginner-level project. Expect a learning-by-doing approach—not perfection. I’m documenting each step honestly, and I welcome suggestions, constructive criticism, and insights from the community.
