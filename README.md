# Cloud-Security
  # ☁️ 100 Days of AWS Cloud Security

Welcome to my first hands-on project exploring real-world scenarios in cloud computing security! This beginner-level journey spans 100 days of learning and experimentation with AWS services, focusing on foundational security practices.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Understand and apply core cloud security principles
- Gain practical experience with key AWS services such as:
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Build a solid foundation for advanced cloud security concepts

---

## 📌 Why AWS?
I've chosen **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** because:
- It’s the most widely used cloud platform globally
- It offers strong security tools and resources
- It has high demand in the job market  
> *(Azure and GCP are excellent too, but AWS is my launchpad for learning.)*

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- AWS Console & CLI
- EC2, S3, IAM, VPC
- Basic Networking & Security Groups
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 📅 Progress Tracker
| Week | Task Description | Status |
|-----|------------------|--------|
| 1   | Set up AWS account, launch first EC2 instance, & review IAM basics | ✅ Completed |
| 2   | Configure Security Group rules | 🔄 In Progress |
| 3   |  | ⏳ Upcoming |
| ... | ... | ... |

> *(This table will be updated daily as the project progresses.)*

## 🔰 Important Note
This is a beginner-level project. Expect a learning-by-doing approach—not perfection. I’m documenting each step honestly, and I welcome suggestions, constructive criticism, and insights from the community.

## 🎓 Personal Motivation

I embarked on this project to sharpen the skills I gained during the **Cohort 2 Cloud Computing Training** with [@3MTTNigeria](https://twitter.com/3MTTNigeria). A huge shoutout to [@NITDANigeria](https://twitter.com/NITDANigeria) for organizing and making such impactful learning possible.

This hands-on journey will help me:
- Translate theory into practice
- Simulate real-world Cloud Security (CloudSec) scenarios
- Build confidence in deploying secure and scalable solutions on AWS

It’s not just a technical exercise—it’s my path to mastery through practice and perseverance.
