# üü¢ Getting Started with AWS Cloud Security

Welcome! This guide walks you through the foundational steps for starting your journey with AWS Cloud Security. Whether you're new to cloud computing or just new to AWS, this will get you up and running smoothly.

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:
- A stable internet connection
- A laptop or desktop with a modern browser
- A GitHub account (for version control and documentation)
- A valid email to sign up for AWS

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. I Created an AWS Account
- Visit [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
- Click **Create an AWS Account**
- Follow the prompts to verify your email, payment method, and identity
- Select the **Free Tier** to avoid charges during early learning

### 2. I Set Up IAM User
- Go to **IAM Console** from your AWS dashboard
- Create a new IAM user with Administrator Access (for learning purposes) `junior-analyst`
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for enhanced security

# üîê Deep Dive: IAM Policies in AWS

Understanding **IAM Policies** is critical for maintaining secure and well-governed access in AWS environments. They define *who* can do *what*, *where*, and *under what conditions*.

---

## üß† What Are IAM Policies?

IAM Policies are JSON documents that explicitly state permissions. They‚Äôre attached to:
- **Users**
- **Groups**
- **Roles**

Policies work by evaluating permissions in the form of:
- `json
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "*"
 }`
    
The core components include:
- Effect: Either "Allow" or "Deny"
- Action: What actions are permitted (e.g., ec2:StartInstances)
- Resource: Which AWS resource the policy affects
- Condition: Optional filters based on time, IP, MFA, etc.

üéØ Types of IAM Policies
| Type | Description | Example | 
|-----|------------------|--------|
| Managed Policies | Pre-built and maintained by AWS or created by users | AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess | 
| Inline Policies | Embedded directly within a user, group, or role for a specific purpose | Custom EC2 start/stop logic | 
| Permission Boundaries | Advanced control to limit maximum allowed permissions | Used with IAM roles in automation | 



üîç How Policies Are Evaluated
Policies are evaluated using logical rules:
- Explicit Deny always overrides an Allow
- If no matching policy statement is found, access is implicitly denied
- All relevant policies (attached to user, group, or role) are evaluated together

üß™ Policy Simulator Testing
To verify how permissions behave before applying them, use the IAM Policy Simulator. You can:
- Simulate actions across multiple AWS services
- Test existing managed or custom policies
- Identify permission gaps or unintended access
üß≠ Your Practical Discovery
You tested AmazonS3FullAccess and confirmed:
- Full access to S3 actions like GetObject and PutObject
- Denial of unrelated actions (e.g., AWS Config‚Äôs DeleteConformancePack)
That‚Äôs exactly the kind of real-world validation that makes you a smarter cloud security practitioner.

üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using overly permissive "Resource": "*" in production
- Forgetting to apply conditions (like MFA or IP checks)
- Attaching policies directly to users instead of using roles or groups
- Not testing policies before deployment

## üß™ IAM Policy Simulation: AmazonS3FullAccess vs AWS Config Actions

As part of understanding how IAM policies behave in specific contexts, I ran a simulation using the **IAM Policy Simulator** for a group named `Analyst`, which had the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy attached.

### üîç What I Tested
I simulated the following AWS Config actions:
1. `DeletePendingAggregation`
2. `DeleteRemediationConfiguration` (Resource: RemediationConfiguration)
3. `DeleteConfigurationAggregator` (Resource: ConfigurationAggregator)
4. `DeleteConformancePack` (Resource: ConformancePack)

### ‚ùå Results
- All actions were **Denied**, due to **implicit denial** (no matching policies for these actions).
- This confirms that the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy does *not* grant permissions for AWS Config operations‚Äîshowing how precise policy scopes are.

### ‚úÖ What I Learned
- IAM policies are **action-specific** and must explicitly define permissions for each AWS service.
- Using the **IAM Policy Simulator** is a reliable way to verify access *before* deployment or testing in live environments.
- Policy simulation avoids accidental misconfigurations and reinforces the importance of least privilege.

## üß™ IAM Policy Simulation: Validating AmazonS3FullAccess Scope

Continuing my IAM policy evaluation, I simulated S3-related actions for a user named `Sar Williams` who was attached to the managed policy `AmazonS3FullAccess`.

### üîç Actions Simulated
I focused on key S3 operations across buckets and objects:
- `s3:ListBucket`
- `s3:GetObject`
- `s3:PutObject`
- `s3:DeleteObject`
- `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
- AWS Config action: `DeletePendingAggregationRequest`

### ‚úÖ Simulation Results
- All **Amazon S3 actions** returned **Allowed** with a matching policy statement.
- The AWS Config action was **Denied** due to no matching permissions.

### üß† What I Learned
- `AmazonS3FullAccess` fully supports bucket-level and object-level interactions.
- No cross-service permissions are granted‚ÄîAWS Config actions require their own explicit policies.
- The IAM Policy Simulator is essential for verifying granular access and refining policy design.

### 3. Launch Your First EC2 Instance
- Navigate to the **EC2 Console**
- Click **Launch Instance**
- Choose a Free Tier eligible AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2023)
- Select instance type: `t2.micro`
- Configure security group: open SSH (port 22) for access

### 4. Create an S3 Bucket
- Go to the **S3 Console**
- Click **Create Bucket**
- Name your bucket and choose a region
- Uncheck "Block all public access" if you plan to test public object access
